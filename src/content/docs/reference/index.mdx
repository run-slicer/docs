##### So, you want to look at some Java classes?

You might want to start with the [Disassembly](/reference/disasm) page, especially if you're new to decompilation/disassembly in general.
It provides an overview of the tools available in slicer, including their strengths and weaknesses.

If you're looking for the graphing capabilities, check out the [Graph](/reference/graph) page,
which describes the flow graph and inheritance tree visualizations.

If you want to learn more about searching in class files or familiarize yourself with the pseudocode output,
the [Analysis](/reference/analysis) page is for you.
